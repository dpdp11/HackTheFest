# py-lua-comparison

This sub-directory compares Lua to Python.

As someone who doesn't understand Python at the moment; this will be a learning resource for both me and other Lua programmers, and maybe those who want to learn Lua from Python. If you find the code I write in Python not so good, please make a change to it.
