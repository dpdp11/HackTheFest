# py-lua-comparison

This sub-directory compares Lua to Python.

As someone who doesn't understand Python at the moment; this will be a learning resource for both me and other Lua programmers, and maybe those who want to learn Lua from Python. If you find the code I write in Python not so good, please make a change to it.

As an example, you can compare both outputs of beginner scripts using the following commands:

```bash
# assuming you are in the py-lua-comparison folder (cd <repo>/py-lua-comparison)
python3 beginners/printglobals.py
```

```bash
# assuming you are in the py-lua-comparison folder (cd <repo>/py-lua-comparison)
lua beginners/printglobals.lua
```
